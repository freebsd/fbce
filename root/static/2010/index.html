    <h2>Core Bylaws</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Active committers have made a commit to the tree in the last 12 months.</li>
      <li>Core consists of 9 elected active committers.</li>
      <li>Core elections are held every 2 years, first time September 2000.</li>
      <li>Core members and committers may be ejected by a 2/3 vote of core.</li>
      <li>If the size of core falls below 7, an early election is held.</li>
      <li>A petition of 1/3 of active committers can trigger an early election.</li>
      <li>All elections will be run as follows:
	<ul>
          <li>Core appoints and announces someone to run the election.</li>
          <li>1 week to tally active committers wishing to run for core.</li>
          <li>4 weeks for the actual vote.</li>
          <li>1 week to tally and post the results.</li>
          <li>Each active committer may vote once in support of up to nine nominees.</li>
          <li>New core team becomes effective 1 week after the results are posted.</li>
          <li>Voting ties decided by unambiguously elected new core members.</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>These rules can be changed by a 2/3 majority of committers if at least 50% of active committers cast their vote.</li>
    </ul>
