# Initialize PostgreSQL

# Create a regular user and database for FBCE
createuser -S -D -R fbce

# Create the schema
psql -f db/fbce.sql fbce fbce

# Regenerate the DBIC schema

# Note that this will not overwrite lib/FBCE/Model/FBCE.pm, but
# instead create lib/FBCE/Model/FBCE.pm.new.  You may replace the old
# file with the new, but you should remove the connect_info and place
# it in fbce_local.conf instead (copy the <Model::FBCE> section from
# fbce.conf and insert the correct host, user and password).
