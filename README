This is the FreeBSD Core team election system.

It is written in Perl, using the Catalyst MVC framework and the
DBIx::Class ORM.

You will need to install the following packages to run FBCE:

pkg install \
    p5-Catalyst-Action-RenderView \
    p5-Catalyst-Authentication-Store-DBIx-Class \
    p5-Catalyst-Model-DBIC-Schema \
    p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Authentication \
    p5-Catalyst-Plugin-ConfigLoader \
    p5-Catalyst-Plugin-DateTime \
    p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Session \
    p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Session-State-Cookie \
    p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Session-Store-FastMmap \
    p5-Catalyst-Plugin-Static-Simple \
    p5-Catalyst-Runtime \
    p5-Catalyst-View-TT \
    p5-Crypt-SaltedHash \
    p5-FCGI-Engine \
    p5-MooseX-Types-Common \
    p5-MooseX-Types-DateTime-MoreCoercions \
    p5-Text-WikiFormat

In addition, you will need a database (PostgreSQL recommended) and the
corresponding DBD module (p5-DBD-Pg).  See db/notes for information on
how to create and populate the database.
